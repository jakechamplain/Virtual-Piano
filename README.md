# Virtual Piano
* Play the notes C4-C5 using the computer keyboard
* Each tone is mapped to a specific keyboard key
* This was my final project for the CSI-370 Computer Architecture class at Champlain College

## Assembly
All of the floating point arithmetic is done using inline assembly using the FPU register stack

* Microsoft has some good documentation on this [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/assembler/inline/inline-assembler?view=vs-2019)
* The professor for the class, Brian Hall, wrote the textbook for out class. The github has a 
lot of great info on assembly, and some examples [here](https://github.com/brianrhall/Assembly/)
* Chapter 9 has inline assembly examples for Mac (GAS), Windows (MASM), and Linux (NASM)

## SFML
This project uses the SFML audio library to process the audio
The documentation that I used to set up the library in Visual Studio can be found [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)

## Contributing
Feel free to branch and play with the code yourself. I prefer not to change anything as to keep the code 'as-is' for reference.
